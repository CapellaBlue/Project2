# Project2

\yärn\
 How do you create a tale worth telling? \yärn\ accesses the insights of intellectual/sociologist/writer/teacher Joseph Campbell to teach users the fundamental plot compents of most mythology written throughout human history.  Campbell calls this The Hero's Journey in his works. Through \yärn\, you are gently prompted through each plot milestone while allowed full creativity to explore any topic you desire. The purpose is show any user that he or she can use The Hero's Journey to create a magical and engaging story.

Technical Details:
FUll CRUD app utilizing MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.  The site uses jQuery to aid the user experience in creating stories and editing stories.

Technical Challenges:
  The production of this project involved several challenges for me. Specifically, the creation of the project idea itself.  Understanding the scope of applicability with CRUD apps was difficult for me as I was learning the process.  Now that the site is fully connected and working properly, it seems simple to me. Error decoding initially caused hours on google.  Throw errors, "Property of Null"s, and undefined's plagued my existence.  Each one, however, has taught me where to look and how to navigate my site's connections with a deeper understanding of how the logic is connected.
  
  How the site should help the User create a story was also very compplex to parse out. Should the user just plug in single words like a mad lib? Should the user write text? What method will properly achieve the goal of the project (to aid Users in their ability to create an engaging story?).

Improvements:
  I want to do numerous things to improve the experience of this site: 
~Connect the creation of a new user with signing in so that a new user doesn't need to sign-in after they've just registered.

~Add default user img urls so no user goes without an image.

~Add Bootstrap framworks to add more stricture to certain pages like the Community page and the User Show pages.

~Implement the ability to add liking and trending capabilities to each story created.

~Consider using JQuery UI to add more user friendly and modern experience.

~Dictionary API to source words for user interaction with story creation.

~Improve this MD file with screenshots.
